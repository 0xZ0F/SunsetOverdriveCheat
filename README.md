# Sunset Overdrive Cheat Table

## !!!READ - IMPORTANT!!!

## !!! The first thing you need to do is check the "Find Player Base" box first. This is needed for a few other cheats.

This cheat is still in development.

### How To Use:

	To enable any cheat (besides teleport save/load) you just tick the box next to it. For further instructions, continue reading.

### IMPORTANT NOTES:

	If you close the cheat before you close the game, you will have to restart the game. This is an issue that I will look into for future versions.
	!!! The first thing you need to do is check the "Find Player Base" box first. This is needed for a few other cheats.
	You will need to active the playerbase box and the teleport box to make everything work and get access to all cheats.

### Features:

	Set Money/OC (Visual Only) will change your Money and OverCharge however it is only a visual change.
	Give Money/OC is not visual only and is permanent. You need to pickup Money/OC to make the change.
	Invincibility will make you invincible. This is real invincibility not some junk that just sets the respective memory to 100 repeatedly.
	Infinite Ammo will make it so you never run out of ammo as long as you have some before you enable it. Note: Not tested with all weapons.
	Teleportation (read below)
	The dev section is for me or anyone else who wants to develop off this cheat.
	More to come...

### Teleportation:

	F9 to save location that you can later teleport to.
	F10 to teleport to the saved location.
	X,Y,Z is fiddly, sometimes you can use it to teleport to a specified location but that usually doesn't work. I don't know why.

### Soon (Maybe):
    
    Trainer instead of table.
    Custom teleportation.
    ???
